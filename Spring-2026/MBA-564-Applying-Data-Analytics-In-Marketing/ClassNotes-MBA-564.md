## Module 1: Causal Analysis

#### Causal Analysis Explained Simply
- Causal analysis is a set of techniques that help marketers figure out why things happen, not just that they happen together. For example, if you notice that people who use your mobile app also spend more money, causal analysis helps you determine whether the app actually caused them to spend more, or if big spenders were just more likely to download the app in the first place.

- Causality means that one thing (A) directly causes another thing (B) to happen—changing A will change B. This is different from correlation, where two things just happen to move together without one causing the other (like ice cream sales and drowning deaths both rising in summer—ice cream doesn't cause drowning; hot weather affects both).
- The module teaches you that to prove causality, you need three things: (1) the cause must happen before the effect, (2) the cause and effect must be related, and (3) you must rule out other explanations. Since running perfect experiments (like randomly assigning customers to use an app or not) isn't always possible, marketers use clever workarounds like "difference-in-differences" (comparing changes over time between groups) or "matching" (finding similar people to compare).
- The big challenge is selection bias—when the people who choose to do something (like download an app) are already different from those who don't, making it hard to know if the app itself had any effect. Understanding these concepts helps marketers make smarter decisions about what actually drives results, rather than wasting money on things that only appear to work.
